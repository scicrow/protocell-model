dopc files are from R:\A-J\Biomolecular_Model-MANCER-HS00092\Cryoprotectants_in_dehydration\Topaz\AMBER\BilayerSystems\final\dopc128x1_42w-lipid17\memb_build

dopc = 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine

using it here to test amber forcefield LIPID21 is working correctly.

leap.in is the file to run the simulation. needs ambertools and acpype

the lipid17 files are the old ones from James's project used as inputs. tleap turned them into lipid21 files

 dopc128x1...amb2gmx is the directory with the gromacs files. Generated ucing acpype
