@Tom @Shani I have put the files for you projects on the R drive under R:\A-J\Biomolecular_Model-MANCER-HS00092\Origins_of_life\Lipid21-GAFF2_hybrid
We can start of reusing Jame's structure files for some of your systems (with a few tweaks), but you will need to eventually need to set up your own using Packmoi.
James' packmol files are under R:\A-J\Biomolecular_Model-MANCER-HS00092\Origins_of_life\JAMES_EXTRA\Documents\amber_systems\packmol_reorder\bilayer
