energy minimization
 &cntrl
  imin=1, 	! flag for minimization. 1 = this is a minimization run
  ntx=1, 	! option to read initial coords, velocities and box size from inpcrd file. 1 = cooords but not velocities. 
		! 5=coords and velocities
  irest=0, 	! flag to restart simulation. 0 = no restart but run as a new sim. 
		! 1 = it's a restart and timestep and velocities read in.
  maxcyc=2000,	! the number of maximum cycles for minimization -- cuts off at this point
  ncyc=1000, 	! if NTMIN is 1 then minimization will be switched from steepest descent to conjugate gradient after NCYC cycles
		! default = 10
  ntpr=100, 	! mdout and mdinfo files are written every ntpr steps
  ntwx=0, 	! trajectory file written every ntpr steps
  cut=8.0, 	! cutoff for bonded interactions (angstrom)
