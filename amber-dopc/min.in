# Run Minimization - Eliminate Bad Contacts
# Energy minimization step is necessary because bad contacts created by addition of water, hydrogens, and other atoms need to be removed.
# Without this minimization step, the energy in that bad contact region can be too high enough to crash the simulation.
# Minimization moves the atoms based on the forces and finds the closest structure at its energy minimum.

# imin = 1      :Choose a minimization run
