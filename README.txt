By Thomas Crow

The Project:
Primordial cells (protocells) are presumed to have combined primitive nucleic acids (most likely RNAs) that acted as catalysts and carriers of genetic information, within a protective membrane made up of amphiphilic molecules. The aggregation of simple amphiphiles such as fatty acids, which have been found in meteorites, would have led to the spontaneous formation of simple vesicles. Recent experimental evidence suggests that certain nucleic acid bases and sugars can stabilize these vesicles against the deleterious effects of high salt concentrations that likely existed on Earth nearly 4 billion years ago. However, the molecular mechanism of formation and stabilization of these vesicles under harsh prebiotic conditions remains unknown, as is the reason of why specific nucleic acid bases and sugars were selected through chemical evolution. This project will use molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the stability of model vesicle bilayers made of simple fatty acids with and without a high concentration of salt and with and without simple sugar molecules and/or nucleic acid bases. The predicted structure and stability of these lipid vesicles will provide insights into how certain simple organic molecules were selected by chemical evolution to stabilize these precursors to proto-cells in early Earth.
